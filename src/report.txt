This file will track what we have implemented thus far

Terminals:
	Recieve is done
	Transmit is done

Trap:
	Kernel
	Clock {It says that its round robin but we will check more}
	Illegal
	Memory
	Math
	Receive
	Transmit
	Abort {Logic mostly fixed}

Syscalls:
	Checked all major syscall and I/O
	Need to verify pipes, cvar, anc lock




Test:
	Math.c:
		Simple file to abort a child with a math trap. 
		The child always prints first
		It aborts and does not print it second message
		The parent reaps its value correctly
		The parent exits 40
		Status: Passed :)

	getpid_test.c:
		Simple test for GetPid, TtyWrite, and Exit
		Returns pid 1
		Writes it out to terminal 0
		Exits with 0
		Status: Passed :)

	getpid.c:
		Simple file to test GetPid and Exit
		Returns pid 1 {Since there is no Fork}
		Exits with 100
		Status: Passed :)

	torture.c:
		Lots of fun
		Bunch of random stuff happening the terminal
		Does not crash though :)
		Status: Passed :) {If not crashing means passed}

	forky.c:
		Fork testfile
		Parent or child can print a message first to terminal 0
		Parent gets trapped in Wait
		Child writes out its status {0} and pid {2}
		Child exits with 45
		Parent writes out its status {45} and pid {1} (45 since it reaps it from the child)
		Parent exits with 45
		Status: Passed :)
	wait.c:
		Spawn in one child process
		Write to terminal 0
		Exit 10
		Parent wakes up and writes to terminal 0
		Parent is back on wait
		Spawn in another child process
		Write to terminal 0
		Exit 20
		Parent wakes up and writes to terminal 0
		Parent exits
		Status: Passed :)

	tty_test.c:
		Fork a process
		Parent or child writes to terminal first
		Parent stuck in Wait
		Child waits for input to be read from terminal 0
		Child reads input and then leaves
		Child exits with 43
		Parent wakes up
		Parent Writes to terminal
		It does not get stuff in a infinite loop 
		parent waits to read input from terminal 0
		exits with 43
		Status: Passed :)
	
	read_test.c:
		This test is to test my string concatenation logic}
		Write to terminal 2
		Delay so that user can input into terminal 1
		I type in many messages and return for each message
		I read from terminal 1
		I then print the message i got into terminal 0 
		Exit with 70
		Status: Passed :)
	zero.c:
		Memory Trap occurs
		Process Aborted
		Status: Passed :) {I think}

	terminal_test.c:
		Simple test to test TtyWrite and TtyRead
		Write to terminal 0 and 3 
		Read from the terminal 3
		Write the input from terminal 3 into terminal 0
		Exit with 67
		Status: Passed :)
