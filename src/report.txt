This file will track what we have implemented thus far

Terminals:
	Recieve is done
	Transmit is done

Trap:
	Kernel
	Clock {It says that its round robin but we will check more}
	Illegal
	Memory
	Math
	Receive
	Transmit
	Abort {Logic mostly fixed}

Syscalls:
	Checked all major syscall and I/O
	Need to verify pipes, cvar, anc lock




Test:
	Math.c:
		Simple file to abort a child with a math trap. 
		The child always prints first
		It aborts and does not print it second message
		The parent reaps its value correctly
		The parent exits 40
		Status: Passed :)

	getpid_test.c:
		Simple test for GetPid, TtyWrite, and Exit
		Returns pid 1
		Writes it out to terminal 0
		Exits with 0

	getpid.c:
		Simple file to test GetPid and Exit
		Returns pid 1 {Since there is no Fork}
		Exits with 100
		Status: Passed :)

	torture.c:
		Lots of fun
		Bunch of random stuff happening the terminal
		Does not crash though :)
		Status: Passed :) {If not crashing means passed}

	forky.c:
		Fork testfile
		Parent or child can print a message first to terminal 0
		Parent gets trapped in Wait
		Child writes out its status {0} and pid {2}
		Child exits with 45
		Parent writes out its status {45} and pid {1} (45 since it reaps it from the child)
		Parent exits with 45

	fork.c:
